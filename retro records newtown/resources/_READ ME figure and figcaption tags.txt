The html5 <figure> tag is a tag created to allow developers to associate images, graphs, pull quotes etc with the main flow of content while keeping them separate.

A <figure> tag can be placed anywhere in the content without affecting the meaning of the document as a whole.

In other words, the <figure> tag is essential to the main content of the page, but it's position on that page can change without affecting the meaning of the content.

Note: <p> tags are not required within the <figcaption> tag.



There are some specific images that SHOULD NOT be placed inside a <figure> tag

- logo images
- icons and site navigation images
- images that must be in a specific position in the content, for example, step-by-step tasks that have images to support each step



Figures Are More Than Images

Applications of the <figure> tag iclude:

- an image, with or without a caption
- content that can be placed anywhere within the flow of content
- videos that are related to the overall content
- a comment or a quotation related to overall content 



Not All Images Belong In A <figure> Tag

If you can answer 'yes' to all these questions, then put the image in a <figure> tag

- is the image part of the content of the page?
- can the image appear anywhere within the content and not change the meaning?
- can the image appear anywhere in the content and maintain its meaning?



How is the <figure> tag different from an <aside> tag?

The content within an <aside> tag is only tangentially related to the main content of the page. In other words, <figure> content is directly related to the page content and the <aside> tag content is only loosely related.

The <aside> tag content is used for extra/additional content and is typically located in many third columns of web pages.



Rules for applying <figure> and <figcaption> codes

- the <figcaption> tag is optional
- only ONE <figcaption> tag can be applied within a <figure> tag 
- the <figcaption> tag can be the first child OR the last child of the <figure> tag
